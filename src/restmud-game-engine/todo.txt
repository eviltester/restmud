TODO:

- game engine should implement save and return a json blob that the game wrapper can deal with -
i.e. the console version should save it to disk, and then should implement a load function,
the web version can send it as a file and create an upload the rest has a get and put command.
    - requires a game state object
- allow save and load of gamestate to be configurable i.e. on/off
- have game level flags and counters as well as player level flags and counters
    - in conditions if there are duplicates between flag and counter names then the player value takes priority
- have game level timers and conditions for timer ==, >=, etc.
- have player specific objects and location objects to allow puzzles to be solved by multiple players
    - although this can probably be achieved by flags
- Object name synonyms
- allow global synonyms for verbs, not just at condition level
- allow location identifiers, not just ids
- allow location identifiers to be used in conditions and clauses
- use markdown or some other syntax for descriptions to avoid putting html in the descriptions, have these parsed to output for various formats
