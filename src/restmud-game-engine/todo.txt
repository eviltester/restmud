TODO:

- game engine should implement save and return a json blob that the game wrapper can deal with -
i.e. the console version should save it to disk, and then should implement a load function,
the web version can send it as a file and create an upload the rest has a get and put command.
    - requires a game state object
- allow save and load of gamestate to be configurable i.e. on/off
- have game level flags and counters as well as player level flags and counters
    - in conditions if there are duplicates between flag and counter names then the player value takes priority
- have game level timers and conditions for timer ==, >=, etc.
- have player specific objects and location objects to allow puzzles to be solved by multiple players
    - although this can probably be achieved by flags
- use markdown or some other syntax for descriptions to avoid putting html in the descriptions, have these parsed to output for various formats

Lower Priority:

- Object name synonyms - but this should be configurable because the whole point of the technical web testing interface is that the object names are visible in the DOM and in the JSON so synonyms do not apply for objects or location objects
- allow global synonyms for verbs, not just at condition level
- allow location identifiers, not just ids - location identifiers are strings, should we add a unique integer id?
    - if we create ids, allow location ids to be used in conditions and clauses
