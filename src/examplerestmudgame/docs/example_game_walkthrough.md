## Warning

Using this game walkthrough will prevent you from investigating the game fully and learning what you can. Also note that I am not a professional hint and walkthrough writer so there is no guarantee that you an use this document without spoilage. I suggest you: read the hints first, dip into and out of the walkthrough, map your won map, only use the map here as a last resort.
This walkthrough is automatically generated from a 'test'. It is created as the game is played. So the output you see here is what the game provides, if you are doing something different then you are playing a different version of the game, a different game, or doing something wrong

## Hints

* use the corridorbutton
* hoard treasure not junk
* the zapherebutton zaps the same treasure to the location
* this is a static map so is easy to automate
* this is a good map to switch off the GUI and just use the api

 _go south through the teleporter to go back to the start_

 _It is a one way gate so I can't close it from this side and it doesn't stop me going west_ 


`close w`

 _I will take the shiny treasure that can be hoarded, and hoard it to increase my score_ 


`score `

Could I probably push the blue button and possibly score again?

And with that I have done most of the things. I could keep dispensing and increasing score, but that is really it.
