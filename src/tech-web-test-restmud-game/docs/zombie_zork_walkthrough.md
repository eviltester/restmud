`look `

> `You look.`

> `1` : `At the House Front Door`

> `You are in front of a house. It is a small house. A scary house. The door to the house (in the north) is locked with a <span location_object_id='very_strong_padlock'>very strong padlock</span>.` 

> I can see some things here:

* `A Welcome Mat` (`welcomemat`)

> ... messages ...

* The Wizard Says: Welcome to the Technical Web Testing Game
* you heard moaning from the graveyard.

 _I might want to open this_ 


`examine very_strong_padlock`

> `You Examine: A Very Strong Lock Indeed ... The lock is very strong. Much stronger than all the practice lock picks that I bought from the hardware store. Those locks I could pick in a few minutes. This one. I doubt it can be picked at all.`

> ... messages ...

* you heard moaning from the graveyard.

 _I definitely want to open the padlock_ 


`go n`

> `did you notice that the door was locked with a strong padlock? that means you can't do that way`

> `1` : `At the House Front Door`

> I can see some things here:

* `A Welcome Mat` (`welcomemat`)

> ... messages ...

* you heard moaning from the graveyard.

### I'll be in the house in a few moments


 _Hello Matt?_ 


`examine welcomemat`

> `You Examine: A Welcome Mat ... The welcome mat has the words 'Welcome Matt' on it. Presumeably this heavenly hovel from hell was once owned by a man named Matt. Sometimes people put spare keys under the mats. Do you think you could lift the mat and see?`

> ... messages ...

* you heard moaning from the graveyard.

 _I wonder if Matt is under here_ 


`lift welcomemat`

> `you lifted matt's mat`

> ... messages ...

* it occurs to you to lift the mat and look under it, you see a small wire. i wonder if you can use wire to pick the lock?
* you heard moaning from the graveyard.

`look `

> `You look.`

> `1` : `At the House Front Door`

> I can see some things here:

* `A Welcome Mat` (`welcomemat`)

> ... messages ...

* you heard moaning from the graveyard.

 _I did see something_ 


`take lockpickwire`

> `You took: lockpickwire. You now have the A thin wire that lock pickers can USE to pick locks. `

> ... messages ...

* you heard moaning from the graveyard.

 _Ha, I'll just pick the lock and be done with it_ 


`use lockpickwire`

> `you try to use the wire to pick the lock`

> ... messages ...

* believing that since you are in an adventure game you have all your normal real world skills. and since in the real world you are an expert lock picker using wires that you found on the ground under old bits of cloth with words written on them. you stick the wire in the lock expecting it to open. but it doesn't. because you aren't in the real world now. you are in adventure game land. and there are zombies. and you can't. so the lock doesn't open. but you know now that you can't pick locks, so that's something.
* you heard moaning from the graveyard.

> `You Examine: Matt's Letter ... Dear Adventurer<br/>I accidentally build my house in a graveyard and zombies try to eat me. Thanks for visiting. I hope you have a nice time here. I've locked the door so you'll probably want to find a key to try and get in.<br/>Don't take too long, otherwise the zombies might eat you.

> `4` : `At the North side of the House`

> `You are at back of the house. It is a small house. etc. graveyard etc. scary things moving etc. The back door is blocked. It looks as though someone bricked up the door, then covered it in wooden planks and then stuck bars over them. There is no way that you are going to go South into the house through that door. Actually it isn't really a door anymore. To call it a door is to call a brick wall a door, and that would be so wildly inaccurate that I wouldn't do that. Someone even built <span location_object_id='a_small_wall'>a small wall</span> at the bottom of the wall, well actually it is more like a pile of stones but I call it a small wall, what would you call it?`

> `5` : `At the West side of the House`

> `You are at the other side of the house. Unless of course this is the first side you have seen, in which case you are at the side of the house that is new to you. It is a small house in a graveyard with scary things which are scary. Are you scared? You should be. Someone has scratched something into <span location_object_id='scratchedwood'>the wood</span> of the house, under the wood it looks like there is reinforced metal that once belonged on a tank.`

`look `

> `You look.`

> `inhouse` : `You are in the house`

> `You are safely inside the house. It is quiet in here. And safe. <br/> Actually, if you made it here, that's the end of the game. Well done.`
