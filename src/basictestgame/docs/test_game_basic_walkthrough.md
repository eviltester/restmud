## Warning

Using this game walkthrough will prevent you from investigating the game fully and learning what you can. Also note that I am not a professional hint and walkthrough writer so there is no guarantee that you an use this document without spoilage. I suggest you: read the hints first, dip into and out of the walkthrough, map your won map, only use the map here as a last resort.
This walkthrough is automatically generated from a 'test'. It is created as the game is played. So the output you see here is what the game provides, if you are doing something different then you are playing a different version of the game, a different game, or doing something wrong

## Hints

* examine all signs
* look in description html for 'spans' that are examinable
* if you take something that isn't yours then confess quickly
* use things with ids
* map the maze
* if the game says to do something then do it e.g. 'wobble' or 'confess'
* secret ways often mean points
* some secret ways never run out of points
* polish before hoarding
